# darknet-on-arm

An incomplete port of Darknet (and YOLO) to the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 820 processor using the Symphony System Manager SDK to better utilize the multicore CPU, GPU and DSP inside said processor.

This is a fork of Joseph Redmon *et al.* work on Darknet and the You only look once (YOLO) real-time object detection system.
